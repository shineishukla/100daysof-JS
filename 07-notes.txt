The DOM(Document Object Model)

- DOM represents a document as a tree.
- HTML elements become interrelated nodes in the tree.
- Nodes can have child nodes.
- Nodes on the same level are called siblings.
- Document object is the owner(or root) of all onjects on your webpage.

Note: In JS, there is a predefined document object. 

Selecting elements:
1. document.getElementById(id)
2. document.getElementByClassName(name)
3. document.getElementByTagName(name)


Each element in the DOM has a set of properties and methods that provide information about their relationships in the DOM:

- element.childNodes: returns an array of an element's child nodes.
- element.firstChild: returns the first child node of an element.
- element.lastChild: returns the last child node of an element.
- element.hasChildNodes: returns true if an element has any child nodes, otherwise false.
- element.nextSibling: returns the next node at the same tree level.
- element.previousSibling: returns the previous node at the same tree level.
- element.parentNode: returns the parent node of an element.

Changing Attributes:
we can change the src attribute of an image.

Changing style:
All CSS properties can be set and modified using JavaScript. Just remember, that you cannot use dashes (-) in the 
property names: these are replaced with camelCase versions, where the compound words begin with a capital letter.
For example, the background-color property should be referred to as backgroundColor.
