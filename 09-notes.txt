Event Handling:
When an event occurs on a target element, a handler function is executed. 
Event handlers can be assigned to elements.
You can attach events to almost all HTML elements.



Common HTML events:
- onclick: occurs when the user clicks on an element
- onload: occurs when an object has been loaded
- onmouseover: occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element
- onmouseout: occurs when the pointer is moved out of an element
- onunload: occurs once a page has unloaded (for <body> and <frameset>)
- onmousedown: occurs when a mouse button is pressed
- onmouseup: occurs when a mouse button is released
- onfocus: occurs when an element gets focus
- onblur: occurs when an element loses focus
- onchange: occurs when the content of a form element, the selection, or the checked state have changed 
(for <input>, <select>, and <textarea>)


Event Listeners:
The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers. 
You can add many event handlers to one element.

syntax:
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);

event: Required. A String that specifies the name of the event.
function: Required. Specifies the function to run when the event occurs.
useCapture: Optional. A Boolean value that specifies whether the event should be executed in the capturing or in 
the bubbling phase.

Note: Internet Explorer version 8 and lower do not support the addEventListener() and removeEventListener() 
methods. However, you can use the document.attachEvent() method to attach event handlers in Internet Explorer.
