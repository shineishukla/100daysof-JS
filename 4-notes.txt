Object Initializing- 

Methods - are functions that stored as object properties. A method is a function, belonging to an object. 
It can be referenced using the this keyword.

Creating syntax:
methodName = function() { code lines }

Accsessing syntax:
objectName.methodName()


The changeName method changes the object's name property to its argument.

this.name refers to the name property of the object.


Logical Operators -
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. 
Following are the logical operators supported by JavaScript language:
1. && (Logical AND) - If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
2. || (Logical OR) - If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
3. ! (Logical NOT) - Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator 
will make it false.



for-in loop - This loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.
syntax:
for (variable in object) {
  code to be executed
}

for-of loop - This loop is used to loop through the values of an iterable object.
syntax:
for (variable of iterable) {
  code to be executed
}



String methods:-
1. charAt() - returns the character at the specified index in a string.
2. charCodeAt() - returns the Unicode of the character at the specified index in a string.
3. concat() - joins two or more strings.
4. fromCharCode() - converts Unicode values into characters.
5. repeat() - returns a new string with a specified number of copies of an existing string.
6. replace() - searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new string where 
the specified values are replaced.
7. slice() - extracts a part of a string and returns a new string.
8. split() - splits a string into an array of substrings.
9. substr() - extracts the characters from a string, beginning at a specified start position, and through the 
specified number of character.
10. substring() - extracts the characters from a string, between two specified indices.
11. toLowerCase() - converts a string to lowercase letters.
12. toUpperCase() - converts a string to uppercase letters.
13. trim() - removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
14. valueOf() - returns the primitive value of a string object.
15- trimStart() - removes whitespace from the beginning of a string.
16. trimEnd() - removes whitespace from the end of a string.
17. replaceAll() - replaces all occurrences of a specified string/regular expression with another string/regular 
expression.
18. length()- returns the length of the string


String search methods:
1. match() - searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns the matches.
2. search() - searches a string for a specified value, or regular expression, and returns the position of the 
match.
3. indexOf() - returns the position of the first occurrence of specified string/characters in a string.
4. lastIndexOf() - returns the position of the last occurrence of specified string/characters in a string.
5. endsWith() - checks whether a string ends with specified string/characters.
6. startsWith() - checks whether a string begins with specified characters.
7. includes() - checks whether a string contains the specified string/characters.
8. matchAll()- returns an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression, including 
capturing groups.
