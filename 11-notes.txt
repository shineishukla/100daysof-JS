React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().

eg- ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root'));


JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
It is similar in appearance to HTML, hence provides a way to easily write HTML in react.

React apps are made out of components. 
Components help us write reusable, modular, and better organized code.
A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

Crossorigin attribute is used to allow images from third-party sites that allow cross-origin access to be used 
with canvas.

CDN- 
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to 
provide fast delivery of Internet content. The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of 
servers in a secure and efficient way.


React vs ReactDOM:
React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces whereas ReactDOM is also JavaScript library that 
allows React to interact with the DOM.

React components can be created in two ways:
1. Function Components- Function components are basic JavaScript functions.
Function components are used to render information to the web page without using or changing state.

2. Class Components- Class components are more advanced than function components.
Class components are used to render information to the web page by using and changing state.

ASYNC vs DEFER:
Async attribute loads the script asynchronously with the rest of the page.
syntax:
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>

Defer attribute loads the script when the page has finished parsing.
syntax: 
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
