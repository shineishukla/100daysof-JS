# 100 Days Of Code (JavaScript Journey)
Welcome to my JavaScript Journey! In this repository, I will be documenting my progress and code as I embark on a 100-day coding challenge focused on JavaScript. Throughout this journey, I will be working on various projects, solving coding exercises, and exploring different aspects of JavaScript programming.

# Goals
Throughout this 100-day journey, I have set the following goals for myself:

- Gain a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking using JavaScript.
- Build practical projects to apply my knowledge.
- Explore advanced JavaScript concepts and frameworks.
- Engage with the coding community, share my progress, and seek feedback.

# Motivation
The purpose of this coding challenge is to strengthen my skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript. By dedicating 100 days to consistent coding practice, I aim to become more proficient in JavaScript and gain practical experience in building real-world applications.
