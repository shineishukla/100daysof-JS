Event Propagation:

There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM: bubbling and capturing.
In bubbling, the innermost element's event is handled first and then the outer element's event is handled.
The <p> element's click event is handled first, followed by the <div> element's click event.

In capturing, the outermost element's event is handled first and then the inner. The <div> element's click event 
is handled first, followed by the <p> element's click event.


The addEventListener() method allows you to specify the propagation type with the "useCapture" parameter.

The default value is false, which means the bubbling propagation is used; when the value is set to true, the event
uses the capturing propagation.

syntax: 
//Capturing propagation
elem1.addEventListener("click", myFunction, true); 

//Bubbling propagation
elem2.addEventListener("click", myFunction, false);


Image Slider:
An image slider is an image slider and theyâ€™re all about the same, right? Not so fast. What are the main 
requirements for choosing any kind of web component? Compatibility, easy setup, high performance, and nice look 
and feel. With this criteria in mind, we came up with the following list of the best image sliders currently 
available on the market. Most of them are free and some have free trial periods.


Form Validation:
A form is also known as a web form or HTML form. It allows users to enter data that is sent to a server for
processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes,
radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a
product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.

Note: The form will not get submitted if its onsubmit event returns false.



ECMAScript 6:
Also known as ECMAScript 2015, ES6 is the latest standard of JavaScript. It was released in 2015 and has since
been adopted by all major browsers and JavaScript engines. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the
first major update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major
JavaScript engines is underway now.

Features:
1. Arrow Functions
2. Classes
3. Enhanced Object Literals
4. Template Literals
5. Destructuring Assignment
6. Default Parameters
7. Rest Parameters
8. Spread Operator
9. Let and Const
10. Iterators

In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript (ES5). The reason that ES6 became so popular is that it introduced
new conventions and OOP concepts such as classes.
