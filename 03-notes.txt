Day 2 of #100DaysofCode (JavaScript Series)

Objects: objects are a collection of properties. Properties are a key value pair. 
The key is a string and the value can be any data type.

syntax:
let objectName = {
    key: value,
    key: value,
    key: value
}

Two ways to access:
1. dot notation-
syntax: objectName.key

2. bracket notation-
syntax: objectName["key"]


built in length property: is used to find the length of a string or an array.
syntax: objectName.length

Object Methods: are functions that are stored as object properties.
syntax: objectName.methodName()

- document.write() outputs data. The write() function is actually a method of the document object.

Oject Constructors: are used to create new objects of the same type.
syntax: 
function objectName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    this.parameter1 = parameter1;
    this.parameter2 = parameter2;
}

Important: this keyword: refers to the current object. It is used to access properties of the current object.

Note: Access the object's properties by using the dot syntax.
